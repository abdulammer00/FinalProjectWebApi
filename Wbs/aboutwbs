WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)

WBS is one of the first structural proces to start a project. It is aimed to see all the processes that need to be done 
and which will be done by each group member to make a project successful. Each group member will be given 
their respective duties according to their respective expertise. Indirectly simplifies project assignment process.
WBS for this project is shared with 4 phases of the project and each phase has its own process. 

The first phase begins with a research or concept, this phase is in the initial stage to facilitate every member of
the group to see the work scope and project model to be done.

For the second phase, preparation is a stage where each member of the group will be given specific tasks according to the 
expertise such as, for ERD to be done by FAIZ where the relevant process of the website project that needs a very important link.
For BPMN, AMMER, where this process is very important as this process will show how a website's journey will function fully 
when it is complete. Next is the wireframe process by AMIRUL, the initial sketch of a website to be designed in visual coded 
coding according to the previously created sketch. For anaylsis content process and prototype will be done by LUQMAN, where the 
process requires a detailed research to facilitate a website project done without any major defects that could disrupt the process
of preparing the website.

The third phase of the developmental reminders, which begins the process in detail and the initial information collected 
will be used to make a reference during the process of setting up this website.

And lastly, the fourth phase, the demostrate and production stage, where this stage is the stage to test the prerations of 
the website internally before being released into the real environment for users outside of it.
