Salam Sir 
this is the 3 project for web api 
i learn this project from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gnsUsjRTVo&t=15s 
the project did not complete because this is the only thing i capable doing
this subject since i dont have any basic coding.

for dating-spa need to do npm install 
and ng serve , in this we can all see the main interface and able to sign up only 
http://localhost:4200/

however sir can demo in by open the dating-api folder 
but using microsoft visual soft can only see and demo the api 
i did not managed to complete the connection between angular and api because it is too hard
so sir need to do it separately 
when open the microsoft visual studio, sir need to import the project solution in the dating-api file that name DatingApp.API.csproj then click run terminal 
then sir need to manually type http://localhost:53005/ 
then sir can do sign up , view profile , find match , chat , there a few fake user that sir can try chat, like, view profile.
